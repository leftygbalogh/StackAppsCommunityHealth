My reading of the story is not upvotes in general, more like upvotes in the context of the overall userbase. Fewer of us answer fewer questions than any of the other 4 communities I picked on a whim. Not only that, but we seem to reward questions less than the other communities. If I was to make a rash judgement, I'd say we prefer to just harvest what the community has to offer but feel less inclined to contribute and to reward those who contributed.

PS: I am tempted to make a few more queries - if you have one in mind, let us know in the comments and I'll see to it that I find the time to run the best ones as an update to this.
